## A Couple of Projects
I'm starting to learn angular, and so I made a couple of projects.

[Todo List](https://thomasnilsson.github.io/todoapp)
Here the challenge was binding the contents of the table to the todo-item list in the ng-model.
Whenever an item is added, the list is appended with the new item, the model registers this, and updates the view.
Whenever the delete button is pressed, a new list is then created in the model, only containing the items for which the done field is false, and the original list is then set to this list.
