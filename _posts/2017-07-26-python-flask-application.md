I've grown very fond of Python, and I plan to use it as a server side language for my bachelor thesis in the fall. For the bachelor project I will need to handle uploading sound files from a phone to a web server, and then process the data in MATLAB or Python. I then found out Python can be used to create the web and server part as well, and so I decided to create a small web project with Python. 

In this case it was a blog which looks much like this, using the Flask framework.

Flask is a very small framework, but provides as lot of the basic functionalities you need when constructing a web app: routing, templating, form validation, session state, handling uploading and downloading files from the server, and probably much more.
