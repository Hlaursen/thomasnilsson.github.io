For my bachelor project which starts in the fall, I will need to handle uploading sound files from a phone application to a web server. 

The files have to be processed in either MATLAB or Python. I then found out Python can be used to create the web and server part as well, so it seems like a good idea to do the entire thing in Python!

So to get started I decided to conjure up a small project, in this case a blog-like website.

Normally the Django framework would probably be used, but there was a smaller, and more beginner-friendly framework named Flask.

While the framework is very small it does provide as lot of the basic functionalities you need when constructing a web app: routing, templating, form validation, session state, handling uploading and downloading files from the server, and probably much more.
