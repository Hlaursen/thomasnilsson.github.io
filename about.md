### More Information
My name is Thomas, and I aspire to be a software developer. Currently, I am working as a freelancer doing mobile- as well as web-based applications.

Currently I am studying at the Technical University of Denmark, and expect to have a Software Engineering MSc by 2019.

This website/blog serves as my portfolio where I will be documenting my journey and sharing what I learn!
