Currently, I am working as a freelancer doing mostly mobile applications (Android and iOS), but also some web-based apps (HTML5 and JS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these applications I have been been doing both front-end and back-end development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I have been working with the classical LAMP stack, and therefore I know basic Linux server tasks as well. I am looking to transition over to a more modern stack (JS-based), however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I am studying at the Technical University of Denmark, writing my Bachelor thesis in the fall of 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect to have a MSc of either Software Engineering or some sort of Data Science, in the Fall of 2019 (Still a bit undecided, and there is somewhat of an overlap).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">My name is Thomas, and I aspire to be a full-time developer.
